# E129 visually indented line with same indent as next logical line
#   - No real agreement here.  Best to disable it for now

#   - There are enough cases where we want to import in a function
# W503 line break before binary operator
#   - Jury is out on what is actualy more readable
# E731 do not assign a lambda expression, use a def
#   - Not sure this is really correct, till then its off
