Adobe Flex properties files
***************************

.. versionadded:: 1.8

Adobe Flex applications use .properties files similar to :doc:`Java properties <properties>`, but with UTF-8 encoding, and therefore :doc:`/commands/prop2po` and po2prop are used for conversion.

We welcome more testing and feedback, but based on our solid support for properties, this probably works perfectly.
