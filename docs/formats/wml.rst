Wireless Markup Language
************************
This page documents the support for `WML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Markup_Language>`_ and is used for planning our work on it.

This is implemented as a generic XML document type that is handled similarly to the way the :doc:`developers/projects/odf` project handles ODF documents.
