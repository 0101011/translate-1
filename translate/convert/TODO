--force option
  only overwrite files if this is given (work out which tools its applicable to)

detect whether producing a .po or a .pot (make -P / --pot unneccessary)

moz2po
  make strings fuzzy if original == translation

headers
  charset=UTF-8

csv2po
  * change order of columns: original, translation, other stuff
  * It does not currently reflow text to create a newline around literal \n
  making it difficult to check files
  * allow a --no-wrap option so that we remove PO line breaks that mess with 
  translators segmentation tools.
  * We do not handle languages with N != 2 plural forms

pot2po discussion with pavel:
  pot2po should be as simple as using pot as one arg and po as the second ;-)
  pot2po pot po -t po warns me for every file: pot2po: warning: writing to temporary output...
  pot2po pot po -t po does not merge existing translations from old POs that have more then one comment and thus are duplicated in the new POs

po2dtd
  when reporting ampersand check failures should tell you the file not just the
    name of the bad PO file not just the command line output name
